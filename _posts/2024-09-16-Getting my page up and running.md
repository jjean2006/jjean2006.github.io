This is mostly just for me to document the initial process.
Feel free to read through however it probably isn't going to be very entertaining
Or even proofread.

I have another page up and running, which I set up a few years back for my never late project. But that one was very basic and not for showcasing my knowledge and learnings.
Neither did it use a remote community theme which I cannot figure out how to use on this blog.

I found some that I like though:
https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll
https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/blob/master/_config.yml

Time to get it running.
GitHub pages documentation saysâ€¦ many things.

On the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll) it says 
	To use any other Jekyll theme hosted on GitHub, type `remote_theme: THEME-NAME`, replacing THEME-NAME with the name of the theme as shown in the README of the theme's repository.

But on the [announcement page](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/use-any-theme-with-github-pages/) it says:
	remote_theme: owner/name

Neither seem to work, let me try again.
Decided against repeating the experiment with same initial conditions and rather check through previous commits.
I've been typing remote-theme rather than remote_theme.
Okay.
So chirpy seems to error, let me try beautiful.
IT WORKS.
Time to fix chirpy.
Doing a little more digging, chirpy has a different install method.
Before I decide on chirpy I think I'll check out more themes.
After a little bit of digging,
https://long-haul.netlify.app/, I like this because of its minimalist approach
https://jekyllt.github.io/jasper/, A very pretty site
https://piazzai.github.io/cvless/, Extremely simple, but so cool
https://lanyon.getpoole.com/about/, Minimalist, again
Along with the previously mentioned beautiful and chirpy.
I'm gonna take a break for now.

Leaning towards cvless, if only lanyon just had a dark mode.
Probably not going to be beautiful or chirpy. As for long haul I think I like it's idea, the minimalism but not the execution.
Jasper vs cvless.
Jasper seems broken.
So is cvless.
Jasper2 too.
Chirpy it is?

Chirpy it is.
It is 24 hours later and chirpy is up.
And the page is up!
